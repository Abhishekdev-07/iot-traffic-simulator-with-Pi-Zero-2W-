# iot-traffic-simulator-with-Pi-Zero-2W-
A comprehensive IoT traffic control system featuring a Flask web server that synchronizes real-time CSS car animations with a physical LED circuit. This project includes a custom-designed 3D-printed enclosure (CAD), a soldered protoboard interface, and a responsive web dashboard for remote operation via Raspberry Pi.

🚦 Traffic Control Project with Raspberry Pi Zero 2W

A full-stack IoT project that integrates a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**, a **Flask Web Server**, and a custom **3D-printed enclosure**.

## 🛠️ How it Works
1. **Web Interface:** Built with HTML/CSS/JS. It features a car animation for easier visualization of the project.
2. **Backend:** A Python Flask server manages the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.
3. **Hardware:** 3 physical LEDs soldered to a protoboard, housed in a custom-designed friction-fit 3D-printed case.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Python (Flask)**
- **JavaScript (Asynchronous Fetch API)**
- **CSS3 (Absolute Positioning & Transitions)**
- **HTML**
- **Tinkercad (CAD Design)**

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone this repo.
2. Ensure `gpiozero` and `flask` are installed on your Pi.
3. Run `python3 Traffic_Light.py`.
